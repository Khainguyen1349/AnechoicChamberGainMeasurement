# AnechoicChamberGainMeasurement
The Measurement of Antenna's Gain/Directivity/Efficiency requires further analysis for applications. This Matlab codes were made to extract information from these measurements, which took place at the Anechoic Chamber of Orange lab, in Sophia Antipolis. Gain and Direction data are included in folders whose names corresponding. Only one file each measurement is included for the sack of brevity and low volume uploaded.

The measurement is for an array antenna, constituing by 4 coupled-patch element, working at 5GNR FR2 n258 frequency band.

The gain patterns in Elevation at 0° and 90° are shown as following:

The antenna, though built in a lossy PCB stackup, obtained good Efficiency for all element, ranging from 0.5-1.5dB within the frequency band of interest. The following picture has yet to excluded loss from Coplaner line and Connector (0.9dB of improvement expected):
